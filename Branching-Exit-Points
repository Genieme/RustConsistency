Branching or Exit Points : Quad Saga

Names for the 4 functions : 
  fn branchOut() returns ()
  fn branchTo(Label) returns ()
  fn branchWith() returns Val 
  fn branchIf(BoolExp) returns ()
  
Syntaxes of the Expressins : 
  break; or break (); 
  break 'label; 
  break val; 
  ??? break if x > y; ???

we need 'break if' expression. 
'if' is the filter for the exit point : exit iff true.

Usage : inside 'loop' block 
loop { 
  break if x > y;
  // equivalent to js : while (x > y) {... }
  
  ...
}

loop { 
  ...
  
  // equivalent to js : do{ ... } while (x > y);
  break if x > y;
}



loop { 
  ...
  
  // see ada-lang : 'exit when' syntax for an equivalent.
  // 2 or more can be placed anywhere in the the loop, scattered or not.
  break if x > y;
  
  ...
}
Note : that is a lot of flexibility and expressive powess.
Yet the rust core team keeps it from us ?? :)

Please correct the wrong ?? :)

when teaching the branching concept to school students, 
leaving one component out is a disservice. they need complete 
understanding and practice of the concept.

Please Help Us Out. THANKS.
